Personal Perspectives & Additional Context

Views on AI Progress:
- I see AI primarily as a powerful productivity amplifier and systems accelerator.
- In my experience, AI significantly improves efficiency in implementation, experimentation, and iteration.
- However, I believe fundamentally new research breakthroughs still require human-driven creativity, domain intuition, and hypothesis formation.
- For example, my VPN encrypted-traffic detection framework was a novel methodological contribution that required deep systems reasoning beyond automated generation.

Thoughts on LeetCode & Technical Interviews:
- I have solved 400+ LeetCode problems.
- I believe low- to mid-difficulty problems are valuable for reinforcing data structures, algorithms, and implementation fluency.
- Extremely high-difficulty problems are often less representative of real-world engineering work.
- Strong engineering performance should balance fundamentals, system design, debugging ability, and production thinking.

Why I Prefer the Greater Seattle Area:
- I am open to relocating anywhere in the U.S.
- I prefer the Greater Seattle Area because I have close personal connections there, which provides long-term stability and support.
- That said, I prioritize strong technical teams and impactful work above location.

Academic Gap Clarification:
- 6-month gap between B.S. and M.S.: dedicated to GRE preparation (scored 328).
- 9-month gap between M.S. and Ph.D.: timing aligned with advisor funding availability.
- These were planned academic transitions, not career uncertainty.

Hobbies & Personal Interests:
- Drawing
- Gaming
- Traveling
- I value creativity and exploration, which also influences how I approach technical problem-solving.
