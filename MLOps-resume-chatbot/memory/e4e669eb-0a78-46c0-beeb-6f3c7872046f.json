In my experience, AI significantly improves efficiency in implementation, experimentation, and iteration. However, I believe that fundamentally new research breakthroughs still require human-driven creativity, domain intuition, and hypothesis formation. \n\nFor instance, my work on the VPN encrypted-traffic detection framework involved a novel methodological contribution that required deep systems reasoning beyond what automated generation can provide.",
